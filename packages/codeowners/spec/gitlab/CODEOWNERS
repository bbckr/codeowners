# In a Code Owners file, sections are named areas of the file that are analyzed separately, and always
# enforced. Until you define a section, GitLab treats your entire Code Owners file as a single section. Adding
# more sections changes how GitLab evaluates your Code Owners file:

# - GitLab treats entries without sections, including rules defined before the first section header, as if they were another, unnamed section.
# - Each section enforces its rules separately.
# - Only one CODEOWNERS pattern per section is matched to a file path.
# - In a section, GitLab uses the last pattern matching the file or directory for each section.

# When a file or directory matches multiple entries in the CODEOWNERS file, the users from last pattern
# matching the file or directory are used. This enables you to define more specific owners for more
# specifically defined files or directories, when you order the entries in a sensible way.

# If multiple file paths inside a section share the same ownership, define default Code Owners for the
# section. All paths in that section inherit this default, unless you override the section default on a
# specific line.
# Default owners are applied when specific owners are not specified for file paths. Specific owners defined
# beside the file path override default owners.
